This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## RESTful CRUD operations using react (redux, thunk, router, form, portals)
Strmy is an app which (BADly) imitates Twitch. This is merely for acedemic purpose.

Although it is a simple app, it covers -
* OAuth - Sign in with Google.
* react-redux, redux-thunk, react-router, redux-form, and react portals.

P.S. Migration to "React Final Form" coming soon!
